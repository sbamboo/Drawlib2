 - Add "clamps" to drawlib instead of consoletools.draw_info's xCap and yCap
   clamps=[<xClamps>,<yClamps>]
   xClamps=[<xMin>,<xMax>]
   yClamps=[<yMin>,<yMax>]
   ||
   clamps = [<xMin>,<xMax>,<yMin>,<yMax>]

    def resolveClamps(clamps)
      allowedTypes = [list,tuple]
      if type(clamps) in allowedTypes:
        if len(clamps) == 2:
          xClamps = clamps[0]
          yClamps = clamps[1]
        elif len(clamps) == 4:
          xClamps = [clamps[0],clamps[1]]
          yClamps = [clamps[2],clamps[3]]
        else:
          raise ValueError("clamps must be made of 2 or 4 elements!")
      else:
        raise ValueError("clamps must be list or tuple!")
      return xClamps,yClamps
     
 - Test if supressDraw and later draw is faster and less laggy for consoletools.draw_info

 - refactor drawlib to have render/draw and put functions not render/draw with supressDraw for the top-level things like linedraw/objects etc, in an attempt to be more descriptive
