# A little todo list for development :)

 - Conic Bezier Curves
 - circleSector: mX, mY, rad, deg1, deg2
 - Maybe remove shapes.py?
 - custom palette classObject with custom __get__ method to handle hex to rgbAnsi, remember to change the typeCheck to add or isInstance(palette,<Class>)
 - find a better way to convert to-from splitPixelGroup (or make functions for each conversionType)
